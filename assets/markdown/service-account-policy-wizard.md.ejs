# Google Organization Policy Change Needed

| Organization | Resource | Created |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| <%= orgName %> | <%= orgResourceName %> | <%= orgCreatedAt %> |

## What you need to do

Before ShipThis can create a Service Account API key for your game, you need to ensure that your Google Organization Policy allows Service Account key creation. This is a security measure present on some Google Organization accounts to prevent unauthorized access to resources.

If your organization was created on or after **May 3, 2024**, this policy is enforced by default and will need to be changed.

**ShipThis can change this policy for you. Press P to proceed and let ShipThis change the policy.**

If you would like to change this policy manually, please see:

You can re-enable the policy at any time:

```bash
shipthis game android apiKey policy --enforce
```
