# Please confirm deletion

## Are you sure you want to delete this Android Service Account API Key?

<% if (immediate) { %>
- This action **will delete the credential from ShipThis immediately and cannot be undone**.
<% } else { %>
- This action **will delete the credential from ShipThis in the next 24 hours and cannot be undone**.
- To delete the credential immediately, rerun the command with the `--immediate` flag.
<% } %>

**Note: this will NOT delete the Service Account in Google Cloud Console. You will need to do that manually if you wish to fully delete the Service Account.**

## Export your credential (optional but recommended)

If you haven't already done so, you can export your credential to a local file for safekeeping before deleting it. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
<%= exportCommand %>
```

## Confirm deletion

Please type **<%= confirmString %>** to confirm, or rerun the command with the `--iAmSure` flag.
