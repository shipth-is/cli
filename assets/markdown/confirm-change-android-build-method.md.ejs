# Confirm change to export_presets.cfg

**In order to publish your game on Google Play, an edit must be made to your `export_presets.cfg` file to enable the Gradle build method.**

This change is necessary because Google Play requires Android App Bundles (AAB files) for new apps, and the Gradle build method is needed to create AAB files.

You can read more about this in the **ShipThis Documentation** [<%= docsURL %>](<%= docsURL %>)

You are using Godot version **<%= godotVersion %>**, ShipThis will update the **<%= optionKey %>** option in your `export_presets.cfg` file to enable the Gradle build method.

## Do you want to proceed with this change?

Please press **Y** to confirm and proceed with the change or **N** to cancel the operation and exit the Android wizard.
