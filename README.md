## Why use ShipThis?

- **Always a free tier** - Enough build minutes for most solo devs
- **One-command setup** - Use the interactive [`wizard`](https://shipth.is/docs/reference/game/wizard) to configure your game
- **No additional tools** - No Xcode, Android Studio, or SDK installation required
- **Simplified provisioning** - We handle iOS certificates, Android keystores, app signing, and API keys
- **One-command deployment** - Publish to TestFlight or Google Play with a single command

## Quick start

### Requirements

- A Godot 3.6 or 4.X game
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above
- **To publish an Android game** - a [Play Console developer account](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup) (not required for building an APK/AAB)
- **To build an iOS game** - an [Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com)

### 1. Install ShipThis

ShipThis can be installed as a package via the [NPM package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/). Run the following at the command line:

```bash
npm install -g shipthis
```

### 2. Create an account

Set up an account with ShipThis by logging in for the first time using the [`shipthis login`](https://shipth.is/docs/reference/login) command.

> üõ† All builds run on managed cloud servers - no need to install Xcode or Android Studio locally.

```bash
shipthis login
```

### 3. Set up your game

Run the [wizard command](https://shipth.is/docs/reference/game/wizard) to configure your game on ShipThis. The command takes a platform parameter - this can be either **android** or **ios**. Run this command from within a Godot game directory (with a **project.godot** file):

#### Set up an Android game

```bash
shipthis game wizard android
```

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I build my game as APK without a Google Play account?</strong></summary>

---

Yes.

Running the wizard command will create a Service Account Key for automatic publishing, you might not need this when initially building your game.

You can run the steps below to create a ShipThis account, create the game, create a keystore, and then run the ship command. Later, when you need to setup publishing you can re-run the wizard command.


```bash
# Create or login to your shipthis account (OTP based login)
shipthis login --email me@email.com

# Create a ShipThis game - run this in a dir with a project.godot file
shipthis game create --name "My Game" --androidPackageName "com.my.game"

# Create a keystore for signing the APK
shipthis game android keyStore create

# Run the build, skip the publish step, and download as game.apk
shipthis game ship --follow --platform android --skipPublish --downloadAPK game.apk
```
