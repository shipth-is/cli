## Quick start

### Requirements

- A Godot 3.6 or 4.x game
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above
- **To publish an Android game** - a [Play Console developer account](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup) (not required for building an APK/AAB)
- **To build an iOS game** - an [Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com)

### 1. Install ShipThis


Install via the [NPM package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -g shipthis
```

### 2. Create an account

Set up an account with ShipThis by logging in for the first time using the [`shipthis login`](https://shipth.is/docs/reference/login) command.


```bash
shipthis login
```

### 3. Set up your game

Run the [wizard command](https://shipth.is/docs/reference/game/wizard) to configure your game on ShipThis. The command takes a platform parameter - this can be either **android** or **ios**. Run this command from within a Godot game directory (with a **project.godot** file):

#### Set up an Android game

```bash
shipthis game wizard android
```

## FAQ

### Do I need a Mac to build for iOS?

No, you do not need a Mac, but you will need an Apple Developer Account.

ShipThis handles iOS builds on managed macOS cloud servers. The CLI connects to the Apple Developer Portal and sets everything up for you.

### Which versions of Godot are supported?

We support **all stable Godot versions since 3.6**, including:

| 3.6     | 4.0      | 4.1      | 4.2    | 4.3 | 4.4    |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|-----|--------|
| 3.6.1   | 4.0.1    | 4.1.1    | 4.2.1  |     | 4.4.1  |
|         | 4.0.2    | 4.1.2    | 4.2.2  |     |        |
|         | 4.0.3    | 4.1.3    |        |     |        |
|         | 4.0.4    | 4.1.4    |        |     |        |

You can read more in our [Godot versioning guide](https://shipth.is/docs/guides/godot-versioning).


### Can I build my game as APK without a Google Play account?

Yes.

Running the wizard command will create a Service Account Key for automatic publishing, but you might not need this when initially building your game.

You can create a ShipThis account, create the game, create a keystore, and then run the ship command. Later, when you need to set up publishing, you can re-run the wizard command.

```bash
# Create or login to your shipthis account (OTP based login)
shipthis login --email me@email.com

# Create a ShipThis game - run this in a dir with a project.godot file
shipthis game create --name "My Game" --androidPackageName "com.my.game"

# Create a keystore for signing the APK
shipthis game android keyStore create

# Run the build, skip the publish step, and download as game.apk
shipthis game ship --follow --platform android --skipPublish --downloadAPK game.apk
```

### Do I need to create an export_presets.cfg file?

No, the ShipThis build server will generate a valid **export_presets.cfg** for your game.

If you provide an **export_presets.cfg** file, the desired preset values will be merged with the generated file.

### How much does it cost to use ShipThis?

Currently free while in open beta. Planned pricing is on the [pricing page](https://shipth.is/pricing).
